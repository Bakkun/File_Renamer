# File_Renamer
## Software for renaming files.

Firstly you need to specify folder path, for example "C:\test".<br>
Then you need to enter name length. Files are named by pattern: First part - letters; Second part - numbers. If length is odd, then first part length would be (lenght/2+1).<br>
And at the end you need to enter a list of extensions, files with which you need to rename.<br>
You need to enter the list of extensions in the format:".first_ext, .second_ext".<br>
For example, ".jpg, .png, .txt". If you want to rename all files inside the specified folder, enter "all".<br>
